## GDPR Banner Manager

GDPR Banner Manager empowers you to add content elements for shuffling or sliding banners, supporting both single-site and multisite setups on your Typo3 project. Banner campaigns can be added to one or more websites of your choosing.

GDPR Banner Manager is powered and supported by the GDPR Website Manager extension, which needs prior installation for the banners to show successfully.
